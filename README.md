This semester project aims to explore time series analysis using various libraries in python. 
In the first part of the project, we explore various time series concepts such as stationarity, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation. We build on these concepts to explore various models such as $AR(p)$ and $MA(q)$ models, we discuss the various extensions of these models in the form of $ARMA(p,q), ARIMA(p,d,q)$  , $SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_m.$ Finally we take a look at some volatility models such as the $ARCH(p)$ and $GARCH(p,q)$ model.

In the second part of the project, we implement the above models on S&P-500 index of the last 10 years. We train a part of the data using the models discussed and compare the efficiency of each model using a parameter. We also show the python code we use to model using the various time series models. Eventually we compare the various models' performances, before finishing off with looking at the volatility models.
